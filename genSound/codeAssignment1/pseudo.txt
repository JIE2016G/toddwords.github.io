Text is split into words
One word at a time is fed into the system
Each word is split into characters
An interval function plays new notes
The ascii value of each character is mapped to a list of frequencies via modulo division
The frequency is sent to a sawtooth oscillator
Each additional letter in the word has a random chance of becoming a frequency played at the same time on one of several square wave oscillators 
If the letter is not played at the same time it is played sequentially on the sawtooth
A random letter of the word determines the bass note for a separate sawtooth oscillator
