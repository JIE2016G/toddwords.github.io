[Vernacular Spectacular](https://events.risd.edu/event/vernacular_spectacular#.WJzskjsrJ9B) was an exhibition of vernacular and commercial-themed art curated for RISD's Gelman Gallery Cem Eskinazi and Drew Litowitz.

For the opening of the show on 12/1/16 I performed as part of [Gentle Leader](http://toddwords.com/gentle-leader) and did a solo piece using my experimental web graffiti chrome extension, WebWriter. Videos below:
