AD2CART is a music and multimedia theatrical work exploring psychedelic visions of digital consumerism conceived and performed by [Martim Galv√£o](http://martim.xyz), featuring myself and [Alex DuPuis](http://alexanderdupuis.com), and directed by [Kate Bergstrom](http://katebergstrom.com)

I play a talking ad network in the piece who communicates with Martim's character through a custom chrome extension I built that modifies the content of web pages in real time via a wireless keyboard I wear during the performance. I wrote the text of the piece in collaboration with Martim who wrote all of the music.

Ad2Cart was first performed at Brown University on February 17th, 2017.
